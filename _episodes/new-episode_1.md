> ## Benefits of using GitHub `15 min`
> In the same groups, try to think of reasons people might want to use GitHub for code sharing, collaboration and version control.
> Use the <a href="{{ site.collaborative_notes }}" target="_blank">collaborative notes document</a>
> to jot down any ideas you come up with.
> > ## Ideas
> > Some reasons to use GitHub are:
> > - I can easily control which code is viewable and shareable, and which is not
> > - Version control means I never can permanently break anything!
> > - A team using Git can be assured they'll never overwrite a colleague's work by mistake and wreck the project
> > - GitHub can connect you with other researchers working on similar projects
> > - Repositories can be easily cloned and used immediately as a starting point in other work

> ## How to integrate GitHub into your work `20 min`
> Here we will take a look at how you can use GitHub efficiently.  Depending on your language of choice, 
> there are different methods of integrating GitHub into your workflow.  For the purposes of this 
> session, we will demonstrate how to push and pull code from your repository to your machine by using a sample
> Python script in our test repository.
