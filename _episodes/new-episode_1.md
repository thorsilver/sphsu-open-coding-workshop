> ## Getting started with GitHub `15 min`
> The instructor will give you a short introduction to GitHub and its functionality, and demonstrate how to create an account and your first code repository.
> 
{: .prereq}

> ## Benefits of using GitHub `10 min`
> In the same groups, try to think of reasons people might want to use GitHub for code sharing, collaboration and version control.
> Use the <a href="{{ site.collaborative_notes }}" target="_blank">collaborative notes document</a>
> to jot down any ideas you come up with.
> > ## Ideas
> > Some reasons to use GitHub are:
> > - I can easily control which code is viewable and shareable, and which is not
> > - Version control means I never can permanently break anything!
> > - A team using Git can be assured they'll never overwrite a colleague's work by mistake and wreck the project
> > - GitHub can connect you with other researchers working on similar projects
> > - Repositories can be easily cloned and used immediately as a starting point in other work

> ## Your experiences `10 min`
> Now we have listed some benefits and concerns of sharing, go around your small group and have
> each group member identify two items that they have experience with.
> You can choose a benefit and a concern, or two benefits or even two concerns.
> For each one, share your experience of it with your colleagues.
> If you have time, add a brief note about your experience to the
> <a href="{{ site.collaborative_notes }}" target="_blank">collaborative notes document</a>,
> but the focus should be on sharing with your colleagues and listening to what they have to say.

> ## Addressing concerns `10 min`
> We have a list of concerns that people in your workshops might have.
> It's helpful to be able to provide some perspective on those concerns --
> we want to acknowledge that sharing can be frightening or difficult,
> but highlight that it is worth doing anyway!
>
> Again, in your group, choose two of the concerns. If they are concerns you have
> or have had yourself, that's ideal, but they could also be ones that you just
> find interesting.
> Go around the group, discussing each person's concerns.
> Try to think of reasons why the concern should not hold you back from
> sharing your code and software.
> If you can't think of anything, try asking the larger group or one of the
> workshop instructors or helpers.
>
> Remember, it's not wrong to have concerns! We believe that sharing data and code
> is important and that the benefits outweigh the concerns, and we'd like to help
> you understand why and give you any encouragement you need.
