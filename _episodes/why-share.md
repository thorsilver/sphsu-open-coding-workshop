  code and software, and think about which of those reasons might
  apply to us.
questions:

> ## Enumerating the benefits `5 min`
> In small groups, try to think of reasons people share code and software.
> Using the <a href="{{ site.collaborative_notes }}" target="_blank">collaborative notes document</a>,
> jot down any ideas you come up with, so that we have an overall list at the end.
> > ## Ideas
> > Some reasons that are commonly cited are:
> > - Shared software can be built on by others
> > - Shared code can be checked by others
> > - Shared software can be maintained by others
> > - Extensions to some software have to be shared due to copyleft licensing
> > - It's possible to audit and verify shared software
> > - Sharing software helps you hold yourself to higher coding standards

> ## Considering the concerns `5 min`
> In the same groups, try to think of reasons people might hesitate to share code or software.
> Again, use the <a href="{{ site.collaborative_notes }}" target="_blank">collaborative notes document</a>
> to jot down any ideas you come up with.
> > ## Ideas
> > Some reasons that are commonly cited are:
> > - If I share my code, people will find mistakes in it, and that would be embarrassing
> > - My software is badly built, or my code is messy, and it's embarrassing
> > - It takes time to learn how to share and do the sharing -- time I don't have
> > - I don't want to maintain my code or software, and I'd feel obliged to if I shared it
> > - My software won't be as impressive if people can see how it works
> > - People could use adapt my software for purposes I don't agree with
> > - I worked hard on this code and I don't want other people to benefit from my work

> ## Your experiences `10 min`
> Now we have listed some benefits and concerns of sharing, go around your small group and have
> each group member identify two items that they have experience with.
> You can choose a benefit and a concern, or two benefits or even two concerns.
> For each one, share your experience of it with your colleagues.
> If you have time, add a brief note about your experience to the
> <a href="{{ site.collaborative_notes }}" target="_blank">collaborative notes document</a>,
> but the focus should be on sharing with your colleagues and listening to what they have to say.

> ## Addressing concerns `10 min`
> We have a list of concerns that people in your workshops might have.
> It's helpful to be able to provide some perspective on those concerns --
> we want to acknowledge that sharing can be frightening or difficult,
> but highlight that it is worth doing anyway!
>
> Again, in your group, choose two of the concerns. If they are concerns you have
> or have had yourself, that's ideal, but they could also be ones that you just
> find interesting.
> Go around the group, discussing each person's concerns.
> Try to think of reasons why the concern should not hold you back from
> sharing your code and software.
> If you can't think of anything, try asking the larger group or one of the
> workshop instructors or helpers.
>
> Remember, it's not wrong to have concerns! We believe that sharing data and code
> is important and that the benefits outweigh the concerns, and we'd like to help
> you understand why and give you any encouragement you need.
