> ## What does good code look like? `10 min`
> In order for others to use our code that we share, they must be able to understand it!
> In small groups, try to think of characteristics that well-written code might have.
> Use the <a href="{{ site.collaborative_notes }}" target="_blank">collaborative notes document</a>
> to jot down any ideas you come up with.
> > ## Ideas
> > Some characteristics of well-written code are:
> > - Uses standard formatting -- no bizarre spacing, indenting, etc.
> > - Plenty of comments
> > - Includes documentation -- particularly important for complex software projects!
> > - Platform independence can be useful, not everyone uses Windows

> ## Bridging the perspective gap `20 min`
> Here we will discuss good coding practices, and provide some guidelines and tips on how to 
> produce readable, understandable code.  You will learn about great tools that can clean up your 
> code for you, and even generate documentation directly from your comments.

> ## Using version control `10 min`
> For the last part of this session we will discuss using GitHub for version control, and how this can 
> make your coding projects much less stressful and more resilient.
