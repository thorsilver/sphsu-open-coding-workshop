> ## Introduction to Zenodo `10 min`
> In this session we will learn about Zenodo, a quick and simple way to attach a DOI to your repository.
> We will start with a brief introduction to Zenodo, with a walkthrough of its key features.
{: .prereq}

> ## Why should we give our repositories DOIs? `10 min`
> In small groups, try to think of reasons people may want to give their repositories a DOI.
> Using the <a href="{{ site.collaborative_notes }}" target="_blank">collaborative notes document</a>,
> jot down any ideas you come up with, so that we have an overall list at the end.
> > ## Ideas
> > Some reasons might be:
> > - DOIs mean you have a permanent resource identifier that can then be cited
> > - Code with a DOI can often count as an output for various funders!
> > - You can make a specific version of your code citeable, enhancing reproducibility
> > - Zenodo tracks which of your repos have DOIs, which is a helpful reminder of which ones may need that treatment later!

> ## Using Zenodo `20 min`
> For the second half of the session, we will start using Zenodo.  You will learn how to open an account, 
> link your GitHub to Zenodo, and then how to generate your first GitHub release and link it to a DOI.
